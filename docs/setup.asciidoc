# Setup Instructions

On Toledo, a link should be provided to GitHub Classroom. Go there and accept the assignment. This will create your private fork (= copy) of this repository.
You will be given the URL to this fork, which you can use to clone the forked repository to your laptop:

[source,bash]
----
# Needs to happen only once
$ git clone URL gomoku
----

where `URL` is replaced by the URL of your fork.
This will create a directory `gomoku` and download the repository to that location.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Regularly push your project code to GitHub.

This is a safety measure against technical mishaps.
If you were to lose your hard work and have failed to push your code frequently, expect no compassion from us.
====

## Receiving Updates

In order to receive updates, you need to link your repository to my original repository.

[source,bash]
----
# Needs to happen only once
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/gomoku-starter
----

New updates can now be retrieved using

[source,bash]
----
# Needs to happen for each update
$ git pull upstream master
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is your responsibility to download updates as they become available.
You can ask GitHub to notify you whenever an update is made to the repository using the watch functionality (top right corner) provided on the https://github.com/UCLeuvenLimburg/gomoku-starter[repository's website].
