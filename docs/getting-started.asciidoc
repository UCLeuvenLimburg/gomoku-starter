# Getting Started

## Setting Up Visual Studio

* Open the Gomoku solution in Visual Studio by opening the solution file `Gomoku.sln`.
* Add a new "Class Library (.NET Core)" to the solution (in the Solution Explorer, right click on the solution at the root of the tree, choose Add &rarr; New Project). Name this project `ViewModel`.
* Add a new "WPF App (.NET Core)" to the solution. Name it `View`.
* In the Solution Explorer, right click on `View` and select Set as Startup Project.

If you press F5 (= run in debug mode), you should be greeted with an empty window.
Next, let's tell these freshly created projects which other projects they can depend upon.

* In the Solution Explorer, right click on Dependencies under ViewModel, pick add Project Dependencies and select Cells and Model. Definitely do *not* select View.
* Similarly, add the following dependencies to the View project: Cells, Model and ViewModel (i.e., all three).

This leads to the following dependency structure:

[.center,cols="^,^,^",width="40%"]
|===
3+| View
2+| ViewModel | WPF
| Model | Cell |
|===

where projects can only depend on things *below* them.
In other words:

* The ViewModel must be independent of WPF and the View.
* There are no restrictions imposed on the View: it sees all.
