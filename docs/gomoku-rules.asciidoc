# Gomoku Rules

In short, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku[Gomoku] is basically Five in a Row:

* It is played on a grid-shaped board, typically 15&times;15 large.
* There are two players, called black and white.
* Black and white alternatively take turns placing a stone anywhere on the board. Note that contrary to Four in a Row, stones don't "drop" to the bottom.
* Black goes first.
* The first player to make a sequence of five in a row, wins.
* The game ends in a tie if the current player has no moves left.

An optional rule introduced _capturing_:

* When a player can surround two of his opponent's stone (e.g., BWWB of WBBW), the enclosed stones are removed from the board (e.g., BWWB becomes B..B).
* On the next turn, it is forbidden to place a stone where stones were previously captured.

You can play it online https://gomokuonline.com/[here] against an AI (without the capturing move.)
